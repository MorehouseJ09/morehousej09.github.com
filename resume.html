<h1 id='overview'>Overview</h1>

<p>Currently a junior Computer Engineering Computer Science major at the University of Southern California. I am a professional software engineer, hacker and designer and am constantly using the newest technologies and tools to solve exiting problems. I&#8217;m currently interested in applying Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning algorithms to solving real world problems as well as web application programming. Some of my favorite tools/technologies include Javascript, GoLang, Python, Tmux and Vim.</p>

<h2 id='flashquest_technical_lead'>Flashquest Technical Lead:</h2>

<p><a href='http://flashquest.com/'>Flashquest</a></p>

<p>Currently developing the backend / business portal application for Flashquest. I&#8217;m in charge of making technical decisions as well as implementation of our product. I&#8217;m currently building a Ruby on Rails api to serve our data. I&#8217;m building with a Behavior Driven Development first mindset and am using technologies such as Cucumber, Rspec, MongoDB and Amazon Web Services to deliver this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also in charge of building our business portal and am primarily implementing this with Javascript / Coffeescript. I&#8217;m building an Express.js app to contact our api and deliver initial page loads to start our front-end MVC app built on BackBone.js.</p>

<h2 id='extensive_unix__macos_dotfilesscript_project'>Extensive Unix / MacOS Dotfiles/Script Project:</h2>

<p><a href='http://github.com/MorehouseJ09/dotfiles'>Dotfiles</a></p>

<p>This is a current project I work on daily and that has helped my Unix skills reach an elite level. I have built out a series of configuration scripts / programs that I can apply and use on unix servers as well as my local development environment. Some features include an advanced Tmux / Vim configuration as well as generic helper scripts for solving common tasks both locally and remotely daily. I&#8217;ve also expanded this project to include basic boilerplate setups for both Nginx and Apache configurations and deployment as well as various scripts and tools that I have built for different languages including Python, Javascript and Ruby.</p>

<p>This is a web application that I&#8217;m launching for a commercial real estate company out of Vancouver This is one of my first big web projects and is built on PHP using the CodeIgniter framework and a MySQL data store. I implemented a custom Content Management Solution to assist non-technical employees update the company web site. I built this project from the ground up. Along with this project I have tackled several smaller problems such as building / deploying a project, asset management, and custom database searching / indexing.</p>

<p>I created an advanced build tool to help with deployment using Node.js and some front-end development apis such as lessCss and YUI. I also created a cplusplus search engine for the site, and while this isn&#8217;t going to be implemented live, it was a fun way to explore c++ as a new programmer.</p>

<h2 id='directory_sync_program'>Directory Sync Program</h2>

<p><a href='http://github.com/morehousej09/directory_sync'>Sync Repo</a></p>

<p>This is a project that I originally built for a course but have expanded upon since. I wanted a database driven solution for managing files on my local and remote machines so I built an advanced sync program. I&#8217;m currently rewriting the application in GoLang and am implementing pieces of the Rsync algorithm to help optimize.</p>

<h2 id='opengl_heightfield_project'>OpenGL HeightField Project</h2>

<p><a href='http://github.com/MorehouseJ09/opengl_heightfield'>HeightField Repo</a></p>

<p>My first large program with OpenGL was a height field manipulation program. I used OpenGL to analyze images and make a 3-dimensional representation of them for users to play around with. I&#8217;m working on a web based version of the project using WebGL and Coffeescript.</p>
