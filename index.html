    <h1>Overview</h1>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Currently a junior Computer Engineering Computer Science major at USC. I'm a professional software engineer and enjoy working with a multitude of different technologies / languages while elegantly solving problems. I have a strong engineering background that I apply to problems solvable with code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work on anything from 1's and 0's to high-level web application programming. I currently enjoy working with Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Backbone.js and Coffeescript to build web and mobile applications. I'm interested in applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing principles to large data sets to help users find online content. My favorite programming tools include Ruby, Python, Javascript, GoLang, Tmux and Vim.

      <h2>USC Medical School 3D Brain Imaging Application</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently building a 3-d web application that transforms craniofacial MRI data into an interactive user experience. The application allows user to not only learn about facial structure, but also upload their own MRI data to compare and find deformities. The application consists of a C++ program written to extract vector data from DICOM format data as well as a javascript based front end app. I'm using WebGL with Three.js and Coffeescript to implement the interactive experience as well as an express.js app on the backend.
